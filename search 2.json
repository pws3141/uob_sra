Along with some details of what this ERAS programme entails.\nPatient level data on donor/recipient/operative details and outcomes.\n\nConfounding:\n\nbetween the ERAS and centre effects,\nalso a human factor in all of this, with respect to how/ when ERAS is implemented in a centre.\n\nBlood and Transplant Research Units (BTRU) project: Organ donation and transplantation stream"

Additionally, the variance of the group-level intercepts depends on the amount of data within each group.\n\nQ: Is there any way of aggregating the centres?\nHow come both UHW Cardiff and Royal Free are split by ERAS and no ERAS, when ERAS is supposed to be done at a centre level?"

See if a unadjusted model shows any difference in the survival curves. You will need to caveat that this is unadjusted for all other factors and that the ERAS effect could be moping up the centre effect also, but it is a good first ‘look’ at the data.\nA Cox with frailty (centre) term and ERAS as the only fixed effect: as ERAS is so confounded with the centre, we don’t want to be interpreting ‘ERAS effect’ without the presence of centre.\nInclude one or two risk factors that you think (clinically) are the most important."
